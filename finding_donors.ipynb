    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logitic Regression\n",
    "  - real-world application is Fraud Detection.\n",
    "  - Strengths: Logistic Regression is one of the simplest machine learning algorithms and is easy to implement yet provides great training efficiency in some cases. Also due to these reasons, training a model with this algorithm doesn't require high computation power.\n",
    "  - Weaknesses: Non linear problems can't be solved with logistic regression since it has a linear decision surface,\n",
    "  - Good Candidate because: we have too many features and mostly will be correlated features and the problem is binary classification\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost)\n",
    "  - real-world application is  face recognition.\n",
    "  - Strengths: fast classifier and less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "  - Weaknesses: performance of Adaboost is sensitive to noisy data and outliers\n",
    "  - Good Candidate because: it works well for complex classification task as well as binary clasiification.\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "  - Real-World application is face detection and handwriting recognition.\n",
    "  - Strengths: SVM exploits hyperplanes to distinguish two points with distinct labels (Xs and Os). When straight things can not divide the points, it has to transfer them to a higher dimensional space where they can be divided by consecutive things (kernel trick). It appears to be a curving line in the original space, but it is a straight item in a much higher dimension space.\n",
    "  - SMVs are know to be quite efficient on a small dataset, and can be used for both regression or classification. However, they are not highly scalable and performs poorly on large dataset since more ressources are required for them to run\n",
    "  - Good Candidate because:\n",

    "Adaptive boosting is known as **AdaBoost**. A set of algorithms known as \"Boosting\" transforms weak learners into strong learners. Simply put, a weak classifier is a classifier that performs badly but is still superior to guessing at random, such as small decision trees. AdaBoost seeks to turn weak learners into strong ones and concentrates more on classification-related issues. Based on the performance of the previous classifier, it is beneficial to select the training set for each new classifier that you train. Training examples that the boosted model has previously misclassified are given more attention at any given step so that they might be correctly classified by the next weak learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The step-by-step procedure is as follows:\n",

    " - The first base classifier (such as a Decision Tree) is trained and used to make predictions on the training set.\n",
    " - Initially, the weight of every data points are assumed to be 1 and after that based on the first base classifier the weight is updated such a way that number of correctly classified points and number of incorrect classified points are same. To achieve this, if the classifier predicts less incorrected points than the corrected points then the weights of incorrectly classified points are increased and vice versa.\n",
    " - Then, a second classifier is trained using the updated weights and again it makes predictions on the training set and then the weights are updated based on correct and incorrect predictions, and so on.\n",
    " - The strong learner is determined as an accuracy-weighted combination of the weak learners.\n",

    "- My predictions were partially right. I included capital-gain, age and Education Level which is correct.I believe that a person's age and capital gain both reflect their experience and yearly income. I also included occupation and education_level but according to results these were not in the list of top five important features.\n",
    "- I was surprised to see capital-loss influence earnings so heavily. According to results, education_num is more important feature than education_level because education_level is an unordered categorical variable and education_num is numerical variable. AdaBoost algorithm gives these features higher weights as they are better indicators of income, as inferred from the given data. These features therefore, influence the decision boundary strongly."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    " - The accuracy and F-score for full model to reduced model are dropped from 86.30% to 83.75% and 73.56% to 68.89%, respectively. The accuracy score is reduced by 2.55% and F-score is reduced by 4.67%. The accuracy score and F-score are reduced because full model contains 13 features whereas reduced model contains only 5 features. This reduction in accuracy score and F-score is due to complexity of the data which is not captured by only five features.\n",
    " - If training time was a factor, I would go for reduced data as training set because training on reduced data was a lot faster than all features data, whereas the Accuracy and F-score are very close to dataset with all features."
